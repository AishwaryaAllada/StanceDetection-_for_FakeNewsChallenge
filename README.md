# Stance Detection for Fake News using Deep Neural Networks

- Information about the fake news challenge can be found on [FakeChallenge.org](http://fakenewschallenge.org)
#### Various traditional machine learning algorithms and neural networks from simple to complex architecture with wide multiple vocabularies were implemented to tackle the stance detection and their performance is analysed. Ultimately, the best model tried was found out to be delivering the best performance of 80.87% weighted accuracy. This report presents a detailed analysis of the experiments performed on the models and detailed explanation of the final model chosen, which best classifies the stances, as needed for the challenge.
